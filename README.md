This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Exercise

 Create a UI component that renders hierarchical data following the UI Guideline section below, with or without the joining lines and icon, and a web application to demonstrate the component, preferably using create-react-app, preferably typescript and the test data provided.

### The requirements are as follows:

- People with a gender of "female" should have background-color lightpink
- People with gender of "male" should have background-color lightblue.
- Each box should contain the personâ€™s name
- The component should be able to consume any family tree, not just the one provided.


### Assumptions you can make:

- All people have TWO and ONLY TWO parents.
- Parents are defined as two people who have the same children not necessarily in the same order.
- Top level parents will be parents who BOTH don't have parents.
